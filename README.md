#Indian Sign Language Recognition 🤟 | Deep Learning Project

##📌 Overview

This project focuses on Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition using mchine learning techniques. The model is trained to classify various hand gestures representing ISL alphabets or words. 

##🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Python
OpenCV for image preprocessing
TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning
Scikit-Learn for data preprocessing
Pandas & NumPy for data handling
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
##📂 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of images of hand gestures representing Indian Sign Language (ISL) symbols. Due to size constraints, the CSV file and dataset are not uploaded to this repository. However, you can use publicly available ISL datasets or collect your own gesture images for training.
