# 🇮🇳 Indian Sign Language Recognition 🤟 | Deep Learning Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition** using Machine learning techniques. The model is trained to classify various hand gestures representing ISL alphabets or words.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python**
- **Mediapipe** for image preprocessing  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for deep learning  
- **Scikit-Learn** for data preprocessing  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of images of hand gestures representing **Indian Sign Language (ISL) symbols**.  
🚨 **Due to size constraints, the CSV file and dataset are not uploaded to this repository.** 🚨
